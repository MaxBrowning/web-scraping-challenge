# web-scraping-challenge

This project utilized Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter to scrape information about Mars. This information then displayed on an HTML page using MongoDB and Flask templating. The page includes a scrape function that allows the user to update the page with the latest Mars news as well as a new featured image.

**Files**
* app.py - The flask application with a home and scrape route.
* mission_to_mars.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook used to create the initial scrape functions and confirm their results.
* index.html - A template HTML that stipulates content, structure, and design for Flask application.
* scrape_mars.py - A function used to scrape data to build content for the Flask application.
